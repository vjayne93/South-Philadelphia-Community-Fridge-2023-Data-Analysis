# project-3-blue-team

Our project analyzes data on food donation from [South Philadelphia Community Fridge](https://www.southphillyfridge.com). South Philadelphia Community Fridge is an all-volunteer mutual aid organization in the South Philadelphia neighborhood that provides 24/7 no-questions-asked food aid through a network of free fridges and pantries. 

Our Jupyter Notebook contains interactive graphics that can only be viewed on Binder. Use the button to view the notebook on Binder.

To meet the requirements of the project, we have developed two versions of our Jupyter Notebook. Version 1 reads a .JSON file which was created by uploading a CSV of raw data to MongoDB, and exporting the data as a .JSON file. This Jupyter Notebook can be viewed on Binder. Version 2 connects directly to a locally hosted MongoDB database to access the data.

Our dataset includes every "fridge fill" in the year 2023. A "fridge fill" is the organization's terminology for any food donation to a fridge or pantry location. The data was tracked by volunteers who delivered and stocked food.

The five types of "fridge fills" tracked in the dataset are Rescued Groceries, Purchased Groceries, Meals, Homecooked Meals, and Food Drive. <br>
<b>Rescued Groceries</b> are donated from grocery stores, larger food banks, restaurants, bakeries, and similar sources of food. <br>
<b>Purchased Groceries</b> are bought by volunteers with funds donated from supporters. <br>
<b>Meals</b> are made in commercial kitchens supporting organizations, such as Double Trellis Food Initiative, The People's Kitchen, Asian Food Collective, and others.<br>
Homemade meals are made by volunteers. <br>
<b>Food Drive</b> donations come from schools, workplaces, religious organizations, events, and other groups that collect food to donate. <br>
