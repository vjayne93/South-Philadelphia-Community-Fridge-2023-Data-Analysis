Our project analyzes data on food donation from [South Philadelphia Community Fridge](https://www.southphillyfridge.com). South Philadelphia Community Fridge is an all-volunteer mutual aid organization in the South Philadelphia neighborhood that provides 24/7 no-questions-asked food aid through a network of free fridges and pantries.

Our dataset includes every "fridge fill" in the year 2023. A "fridge fill" is the organization's terminology for any food donation to a fridge or pantry location. The data was tracked by volunteers who delivered and stocked food.
